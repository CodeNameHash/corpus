    cite: "C.A. No. 2022-0613-KSJM",
    summary: "Twitter sued Musk in Delaware Chancery after his July 8, 2022 purported termination, seeking specific performance to compel him to close the $44B acquisition. Chancellor McCormick granted Twitter's motion for expedited proceedings and set trial for October 17, 2022. Musk reversed course on October 4 and agreed to close on original terms. The deal closed October 27, 2022.",

      "Bilateral specific performance provisions are enforceable in merger agreements.",
      "A buyer's unilateral claims about seller disclosure failures do not automatically justify termination without a qualifying MAE.",
      "Expedited proceedings are appropriate where a merger agreement has an imminent Outside Date.",

    court: "Del. Ch.",
    year: 2018,
    cite: "C.A. No. 2018-0300-JTL",
    summary: "The only Delaware case where a buyer successfully invoked a Material Adverse Effect to terminate a merger agreement. Akorn had fabricated data in FDA regulatory filings, suffered a 50%+ earnings decline, and actively misled Fresenius during due diligence. Affirmed on appeal. Stands as the rare exception proving how high the MAE bar is.",
    holdings: [
      "A qualifying MAE requires both magnitude and durability — short-term declines are insufficient.",
      "Active regulatory fraud combined with a sustained, company-specific business collapse can constitute a MAE.",
      "Buyer-friendly MAE carve-outs for general industry or macro conditions are interpreted strictly.",

    year: 2019,
    cite: "C.A. No. 2018-0673-AGB",
    summary: "Boston Scientific sought to terminate a merger based on alleged company-specific MAE and rep breaches after discovering that a Channel employee had committed fraud. Court found no MAE; the fraud did not rise to the level of durability or business-wide impact required by Akorn.",
    holdings: [
      "Employee-level fraud, without pervasive systemic impact, does not constitute a MAE.",

    year: 2016,
    cite: "£79B deal",
    summary: "Pending merger agreement during Brexit referendum. MAE carve-outs for macro economic conditions and changes in financial markets prevented AB InBev from walking despite significant market disruption post-Brexit vote. Illustrative of how broadly drafted macro carve-outs protect sellers.",

    court: "Del. S. Ct.",
    year: 2003,
    cite: "818 A.2d 914 (Del. 2003)",
    summary: "NCS Healthcare signed a merger agreement with Genesis, including lockup provisions where two controlling stockholders representing 65% of voting power agreed to vote in favor. When Omnicare made a superior bid, the lockup made it impossible for the NCS board to exercise its fiduciary out. The Delaware Supreme Court (3-2) held the agreement unenforceable as an impermissible lock on 100% of the vote.",
    holdings: [
      "Voting agreements constituting more than 50% of the stockholder vote are impermissible if they irrevocably eliminate board fiduciary discretion.",
      "A fiduciary out cannot be rendered meaningless by a lockup structure — the board cannot contract away its ongoing fiduciary duties.",
      "Deal protection measures must preserve at least theoretical ability for the board to respond to superior proposals.",
