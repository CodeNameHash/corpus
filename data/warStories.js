    title: "The Contract List You Never Finished",
    story: "First deal out of the gate, associates often get handed the change-of-control contract review. Hundreds of agreements, each with a different CoC definition. The junior mistake: assuming 'merger' means the same thing in every contract. It doesn't. Some define it as a merger of the company itself; others trigger on any change in 'beneficial ownership' exceeding 50%. A target company's license agreement with a key vendor might give the vendor a termination right on any change of control — and the business team has no idea. The lesson from Twitter-type deals: flag every material contract CoC provision before signing, not after. Buyers get burned when they close and find their most valuable license terminates automatically.",

    title: "When the Interim Covenants Become the Deal",
    story: "Twitter/Musk is the most public example of ordinary course covenants becoming litigation weapons. Musk's July 2022 letter claimed Twitter had hired and spent in violation of Section 6.1 (ordinary course obligations) without obtaining required consent. Whether true or not, the covenant was drafted broadly enough to create ambiguity. The lesson: in deals with long anticipated closing timelines, sellers need to negotiate carve-outs to ordinary course restrictions that allow them to run the business — hiring freezes mandated by a covenant can destroy value before the deal even closes. Buyers, conversely, want specificity about what requires consent. Both sides should assume the covenants will be litigated.",

    title: "Getting the Outside Date Right",
    story: "A mid-level associate working on an antitrust-sensitive deal pushed for an Outside Date that was six months away. The client's CFO said 'whatever, we'll close in three.' They almost didn't — second requests from DOJ pushed the timeline to month five. The Outside Date extension mechanism only kicked in if regulatory conditions were the holdup, and the outside date wasn't long enough to cover a full second request cycle. The parties had to negotiate a last-minute amendment. Outside Dates in deals with meaningful antitrust review should be set with buffer — 12-18 months from signing is not unusual in concentrated market transactions. And extension triggers should be carefully mapped to regulatory milestones, not just a flat date.",

    title: "The Trial That Never Happened",
    story: "Chancellor McCormick's handling of Twitter v. Musk is a masterclass in using procedural tools to force a commercial resolution. From the moment Twitter filed in July 2022, the Chancery moved with unusual speed: expedited discovery, accelerated briefing, a trial date set for October 17. Musk's team tried every procedural play — forum challenges, discovery disputes, delay tactics. The Chancellor denied them all. The real leverage was the trial date itself: Musk's legal team had received devastating discovery, including internal communications about his own bot claims. He reversed course October 4 — thirteen days before trial. The lesson for senior deal lawyers: bilateral specific performance provisions, when properly drafted, create a credible litigation path. The remedy is only as good as the court that will enforce it. The Delaware Court of Chancery is that court.",
